  abstract={
  Panoramic radiography (Panoramic X-ray, PX) is a widely used imaging modality for dental examination. However, PX only provides a flattened 2D image, lacking in a 3D view of the oral structure. In this paper, we propose NeBLa (Neural Beer-Lambert) to estimate 3D oral structures from real-world PX. NeBLa tackles full 3D reconstruction for varying subjects (patients) where each reconstruction is based only on a single panoramic image. We create an intermediate representation called simulated PX (SimPX) from 3D Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) data based on the Beer-Lambert law of X-ray rendering and rotational principles of PX imaging. SimPX aims at not only truthfully simulating PX, but also facilitates the reverting process back to 3D data. We propose a novel neural model based on ray tracing which exploits both global and local input features to convert SimPX to 3D output. At inference, a real PX image is translated to a SimPX-style image with semantic regularization, and the translated image is processed by generation module to produce high-quality outputs. Experiments show that NeBLa outperforms prior state-of-the-art in reconstruction tasks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Unlike prior methods, NeBLa does not require any prior information such as the shape of dental arches, nor the matched PX-CBCT dataset for training, which is difficult to obtain in clinical practice.

  title={3D Teeth Reconstruction from Panoramic Radiographs Using Neural Implicit Functions},
  author={Park, Sihwa and Kim, Seongjun and Song, In-Seok and Baek, Seung Jun},
  abstract={
  Panoramic radiography is a widely used imaging modality in dental practice and research. However, it only provides flattened 2D images, which limits the detailed assessment of dental structures. In this paper, we propose Occudent, a framework for 3D teeth reconstruction from panoramic radiographs using neural implicit functions, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work to do so. For a given point in 3D space, the implicit function estimates whether the point is occupied by a tooth, and thus implicitly determines the boundaries of 3D tooth shapes. Firstly, Occudent applies multi-label segmentation to the input panoramic radiograph. Next, tooth shape embeddings as well as tooth class embeddings are generated from the segmentation outputs, which are fed to the reconstruction network. A novel module called Conditional eXcitation (CX) is proposed in order to effectively incorporate the combined shape and class embeddings into the implicit function. The performance of Occudent is evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Importantly, Occudent is trained and validated with actual panoramic radiographs as input, distinct from recent works which used synthesized images. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of Occudent over state-of-the-art methods.},
