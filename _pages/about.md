I am a first year PhD student in Computer Scicence at Cornell University. I completed my BS and MS in Computer Science at Korea University, supervised by Prof. [Seungjun Baek](https://singkru.github.io/). More details in my CV [here.](/cv) 

My research focuses on building more robust and interpretable deep learning models. I'm interested in various machine learning theories, especially those related to optimization problems.
