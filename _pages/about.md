I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Scicence at Cornell University. I completed my BS and MS in Computer Science at Korea University, supervised by Prof. [Seungjun Baek](https://singkru.github.io/). More details in my CV [here.](/cv) 

I like the idea of building mathematical building blocks, especially from a machine learning, data perspective, or decision-making standpoint. Currently, my research interests lie in Bayesian Optimization and various theoretical approaches related to machine learning methods.
