I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Scicence at Cornell University, advised by Professors [Alexander Terenin](https://avt.im) and [David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/). I did my BS and MS in Computer Science at Korea University, where I was advised by Professor [Seungjun Baek](https://singkru.github.io/). You can find more details in my CV [here.](/cv)

My research interests span two main areas.
The first is decision-making. We make decisions every day, and I’m interested in developing smarter decision-making methods through the lens of statistical machine learning. My current work focuses on Bayesian Optimization, and I’m also interested in a range of theoretical approaches in machine learning.
The second area is scientific computing. With a background in computer science, I’m interested in how computational tools can accelerate progress in the natural sciences by enabling efficient simulation, modeling, and numerical analysis.
